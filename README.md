## ⌚ Kaggle - Predict Calorie Expenditure 🔥

Welcome to this fun project where we dive into the world of machine learning to predict calorie expenditure! 🏋️‍♀️✨ This repository contains the notebooks and data used for a Kaggle competition focused on this interesting challenge.

Please find the challenge on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e5/overview">Kaggle</a>

## 🎯 Project Goal

The main aim is to build and evaluate various machine learning models that can accurately predict the number of calories burned based on exercise and biophysical data.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Install the necessary libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3.  Explore the notebooks in the `foundation_algorithms` folder to see the data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and tuning steps!

Happy predicting! 🎉
