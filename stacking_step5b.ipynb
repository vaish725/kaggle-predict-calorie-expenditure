    "# Step 5B: Stacking Ensemble\n",
    "Use base models to generate out-of-fold predictions and train a meta-model on top.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Stacking?\n",
    "Stacking (or Stacked Generalization) is an ensemble technique that:\n",
    "- Uses multiple base models to generate predictions\n",
    "- Creates a new feature set from these predictions\n",
    "- Trains a meta-model on this new feature set to make final predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages of Stacking\n",
    "- Combines the strengths of diverse algorithms\n",
    "- Reduces overfitting through cross-validation\n",
    "- Often produces more robust predictions than any single model\n",
    "- Can capture different patterns in the data that individual models might miss\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our Approach\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll use three strong base models (XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest),\n",
    "generate out-of-fold predictions to avoid data leakage, and use XGBoost as our meta-learner."
